## 0.4.1 Reactive Sea-Son Team Quarantime

### This Pandemic has affected a lot of people, especially students. We believe in the power of the community. Keeping that in mind, we have built this social media platform for people to:
- Share their stories during Quarantine time, helping the community by making them aware of the opportunities available (both during and after lockdown) that they might not be aware of.
- Open-source the projects that they have worked on, be it at Hackathons, School projects, etc. so that other students can collaborate & learn in addition to helping the project grow. This will increase community engagement among students and promote the open source culture.
